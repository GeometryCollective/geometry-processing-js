/**
 * This module implements a halfedge mesh data structure and its associated geometry.
 * A halfedge mesh stores mesh elements such as vertices, edges and faces as well as
 * their connectivity information. The latter is particulary important in geometry
 * processing, as algorithms often exploit local connectivity of mesh elements. At
 * the cost of slightly higher memory consumption compared to other data structures,
 * a halfedge mesh enables quick access of mesh elements. For example, it is possible to
 * enumerate the vertices and edges contained in and faces adjacent to any single face
 * in a mesh. Similar enumerations are also possible for any vertex or edge in a mesh.
 * Additionally, its possible to perform global traversals that enumerate over all mesh
 * vertices, edges and faces in an unspecified but fixed order.
 *
 * <img src="../imgs/halfedge.png">
 *
 * The diagram above illustrates how connectivity information is stored locally in a
 * halfedge mesh. The key idea is to split a edge into two directed halfedges. Each
 * halfedge stores a reference to the vertex at its base, the edge it lies on, the
 * face adjacent to it, the next halfedge in counter clockwise order, and the opposite
 * (or twin) halfedge. Each vertex, edge and face of a mesh in turn stores a reference
 * to one of the halfedges (outgoing in the case of a vertex) its incident on.
